"""Lifecycle tests for the second managed service, using the offline fake HTTP surface.

The interface is started with the same fake server the engine tests use, so nothing here installs
the harness, reaches the network beyond loopback, or runs a real interface. What is asserted is the
part that has to hold whatever program sits behind the port: the two roles coexist, only one of
each may run, readiness comes from `/ready`, and stop takes the interface down first.

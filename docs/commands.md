# Commands

Bare `bora` opens the interactive workbench. Explicit operations use:

```text
bora [--version] <command> [options]
```

`bora --plain` opens the same workbench in reduced monochrome presentation. `--help` is available
on the main group and on every command. Typer also exposes
`--install-completion` and `--show-completion` for the current shell.

## `validate`

```bash
bora validate
```

It validates the installed resources:

- JSON Schema Draft 2020-12;
- modes, policies, and reports;
- references and SHA-256 between policy and evidence;
- engine lock semantics and flag coverage;
- cross-cutting constraints a schema cannot express.

Errors report the file, the field path, and the reason. Warnings alone exit with 0; at least one
error exits with 1.

## `doctor`

```bash
bora doctor
```

Shows the version, resolved configuration, OS, CPU, RAM, backend, GPU/VRAM, the managed engine, the
four public directories, and content validation. For each mode it also evaluates the state of the
local record:

- `active`, with the calibrated parameters applied to launches (`ctx` and, on CUDA,
  `--n-cpu-moe`);
- `absent`;
- `candidate` awaiting activation;
- `superseded` schema;
- `invalid`;
- `incompatible`;
- `insufficient headroom` under current memory availability.

A pending candidate is shown as a secondary fact beside the active-record state. `stale` is reserved
for process state; it is not a calibration-record status.

The command creates no directories and fixes no problem automatically. An invalid configuration
exits with 2; a hardware or content error with 1; diagnostic warnings with 0.

## Bare `bora`

```bash
bora
bora --plain
```

Bare `bora` is the only workbench entry; `bora tui` is not a command. It opens Run, Calibration,
Setup, Diagnostics, Pi, Settings, and This installation from a central menu. Every page retains the
blue `Bora Workbench` title and wind/sea frame. Sections use a wider centred layout with distinct
action, exact-command, and styled detail panels; `--plain` keeps all content and actions in reduced
monochrome presentation. Interactive stdin and stdout are required, while explicit subcommands stay
available for scripts and redirection.

Opening and `r` refreshes make no network request or mutation. They may read local files, inspect
process identities, and run bounded hardware and engine probes in one presentation worker; they do
not hash payloads, write receipts, repair state, create directories, start services, or poll.

Arrows or `j`/`k` move one marker. `Enter` opens or selects, `Esc` returns, page keys scroll, `?`
expands help, and `q` quits. Bracketed letters switch the marked action's flags. Settings are
read-only, calibration creates only valid combinations, and uninstall requires typing `remove`.

Selection fully restores the terminal before invoking the existing Click/Typer callback in the same
process. Successful returning actions keep their output visible behind a `Press Enter to return`
acknowledgement, then reopen and refresh. Modes, calibration, update, and uninstall are terminal;
failures and interruptions never reopen and propagate unchanged.

Motion carries no information. Wind and sea animate at 6 fps under the 12 fps ceiling on every page,
sections included, from one shared timer. `BORA_TUI_MOTION=off` retains the static graphic; plain, colour,
encoding, terminal-size, focus, and unmount switches remain enforced. Full details are in
[Terminal workbench](tui.md).

## `engine status`

```bash
bora engine status
```

Shows the active manifest, release, backend, executable, and compatibility with `engine.lock`. A
missing engine is an informational state and exits with 0, with its complete difference report on
stdout. An installation that is present but incompatible exits with 1; its table stays on stdout and
every blocking difference is written to stderr as one redirectable list.

## `engine install`

```bash
bora engine install
bora engine install --force
bora engine install --no-model
bora engine install --no-ui
```

Detects CPU/CUDA, selects the exact asset set from the lock, downloads over HTTPS, verifies SHA-256,
extracts to staging, verifies the executable, and activates a new immutable directory. A target that
is already active and compatible is a no-op. `--force` reinstalls the same target anyway; it does
not disable TLS, checksums, confinement, or the compatibility probes.

The command shows the current phase during cache check, download, extraction, build, verification,
and activation. On a terminal, download and extraction have a byte progress bar with the asset
position, average speed, and computed ETA; without a reliable measurement the other phases show no
invented estimate. Redirected output stays line-oriented. It may use the network and, on Ubuntu
CUDA, run CMake and a build lasting several minutes: the phase stays visible even while CMake has
not finished yet. The `--version` and `--help` probes are bounded to 60 seconds each. The command
installs no system prerequisites and never elevates privileges.

Once the engine is active it downloads the pinned model, exactly as `pull` does, and then installs
the browser interface, exactly as `ui install` does, so that a first setup is one command. After
it, `bora studio` opens a finished chat interface with the model already in its picker.

Two flags decline a download; neither removes anything already present:

- `--no-model` installs only the engine. The model is about 22 GB, so this is the option for a
  metered connection, or when the weights are being acquired another way.
- `--no-ui` skips DeepSeek Harness, which costs about 360 MB and needs Node.js. Use it on a
  machine that only wants the API for an editor or an agent; `studio` and `vstudio` then keep opening
  the integrated llama.cpp interface, and `bora ui install` adds it later.

## `pull`

```bash
bora pull
bora pull qwen
```

Downloads **everything the model needs** — the weights and the vision projector — into the managed
store at `<data root>/models`, and verifies each against its locked size and SHA-256. The URL
contains the pinned revision, so a moved branch or a re-uploaded file cannot change what arrives.

The model name is optional because this distribution pins exactly one model; `qwen` and no argument
are the same request, and any other name fails immediately instead of being read as the default.
There is no third artifact to fetch: MTP is a property of these weights, not a separate download,
and the launcher enables it through engine flags.

On a terminal each artifact shows transferred bytes against the total, the measured rate, and a
computed ETA; redirected output prints nothing per chunk. Bytes are written to a partial file and
published by atomic rename, so an interrupted download never leaves something that looks complete.
Rerunning after an interruption resumes the work at file granularity: a complete, verified artifact
is recognized and skipped.

A successful download also writes the verification receipt, so the first launch afterwards starts
without rehashing about 21 GiB.

## `rm`

```bash
bora rm
bora rm qwen
bora rm --keep-hf
bora rm --dry-run
```

Deletes the pinned model and reports the space freed. The model name is optional on the same terms
as `pull`.

### Why there are two questions

The weights can exist in two places, and the two are not equally yours to delete:

| Location | Who put it there | What `rm` does |
|---|---|---|
| `<data root>/models` — the managed store | this tool, through `pull` | first question |
| the Hugging Face cache | you, or any other tool on this machine | second question, asked separately |

The store is this tool's own directory: deleting from it is symmetric with `pull`, and takes back
exactly what `pull` wrote — the artifact, its verification receipt, and the directory itself once it
is empty. Nothing is left claiming to exist.

The cache is different. It is shared: other projects keep their models beside ours, a snapshot entry
may be a symlink into a content-addressed blob a second revision still needs, and — the point — a
copy there may be one this tool never downloaded. Deleting it is still the right default *offer*,
because otherwise a `rm` that reports 21.9 GiB freed can leave 21.9 GiB on the disk. But consenting
to the first question must never be read as consenting to the second, so it is asked on its own,
after the first, and it defaults to no.

### The flags

`--keep-hf` **skips the second question entirely.** Use it when the cache copy is not yours to
remove, or is shared with a project you still use, or you simply want the store emptied without
being asked about anything else. It is also the flag for scripts: with it, `rm` can touch nothing
outside the directory this tool owns.

`--dry-run` **asks nothing and deletes nothing.** It prints both groups, every file path, and the
bytes each would free. Run it first when you are unsure which of the two locations actually holds
the weights — the answer is often "both", and that is exactly the case where the difference between
the two questions matters.

The two flags compose: `bora rm --keep-hf --dry-run` shows only what the store would lose.

### Answering only the second question

There is no `--keep-store`, and none is needed: answer **no** to the first question and **yes** to
the second. That is the ordinary case right after a `pull` on a machine that already had the model
in its cache, where the store copy is the one to keep and the cache copy is the duplicate.

### What cache deletion may and may not touch

It cannot leave the pinned snapshot of the locked repository. It removes only the artifacts
`engine.lock` names, follows a symlinked entry no further than that repository's own `blobs/`, keeps
a blob another snapshot still references, refuses a symlinked cache directory instead of following
it, and prunes only directories that are already empty. When the last snapshot goes, the cached
repository goes with it, `refs` included: what those refs name is a revision whose files no longer
exist. A repository that still holds another revision keeps everything.

Repositories belonging to other tools are never examined — not skipped after a check, but never
looked at, because the only path the command can build is the one `engine.lock` pins. Nothing is
ever written into that cache.

## `pi`

```bash
bora pi
bora pi --print
bora pi --install
bora pi launch
bora pi remove
bora pi uninstall
```

Writes one provider named `bora` into pi's own model store, `~/.pi/agent/models.json`: the loopback
base URL built from the configured port, a placeholder API key that the managed server ignores, and
the model id `Qwen 3.6` — the same name `/v1/models` reports.

The entry is shown before anything is written, the confirmation defaults to no, the previous file
is kept as `models.json.bak`, and the replacement is atomic. Every other provider in that file is
preserved; a file that cannot be parsed is reported rather than overwritten.

`--print` shows the entry and writes nothing, which is also the way to configure any other
OpenAI-compatible client by hand. `--install` runs
`npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` after showing the command and
asking: this project pins no digest for pi and does not claim to verify it. Without `--install`, an
absent pi is reported with the vendor's instructions for Ubuntu and Windows. `--print` and
`--install` are mutually exclusive, because one promises no write while the other requests an npm
mutation. Neither group option can accompany `pi remove` or `pi uninstall`; such combinations are
input errors rather than silently ignored flags.

Afterwards, with `bora coding` running, use the direct shortcut:

```bash
bora pi launch
```

It launches pi with inherited terminal I/O and the exact documented selection:

```bash
pi --provider bora --model "Qwen 3.6"
```

The shortcut starts no local service, installs nothing, and does not rewrite pi's configuration.
Run `bora pi` first whenever the provider entry has not been connected yet.

### Which context window pi is given

The first line of output says how large the window is and where the number came from:

| Source | When it answers |
|---|---|
| `running <mode> service on port <port>` | a managed service is already listening on the configured port |
| `local coding calibration record` | no service is running and this machine has an active `coding` record |
| `verified non-optimized baseline` | neither applies; the reason is printed as a warning below the line |

A running service comes first because it is the only thing that knows what it is actually serving.
Record reuse also weighs the free VRAM that this very service is holding, so asking the record
during a session would report the 8192-token baseline for a machine serving far more.

The number is a copy: nothing rewrites `models.json` when a record is activated later. That is why
a calibration run that activates a `coding` record ends by naming this command, and why it suggests
`bora pi --install` when pi is not installed.

### Taking the connection back

`bora pi remove` deletes only the provider named `bora`, after showing it and asking. Every other
provider stays, the backup is written as usual, and pi does not have to be installed — an entry
written earlier outlives the package.

`bora pi uninstall` removes pi itself. It shows `npm uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`,
asks, runs it, and then checks PATH again: an installation made another way — the vendor's Windows
script, for instance — is not npm's to remove, and is reported as still present rather than
described as removed. Afterwards it asks separately about the provider entry, because the package
belongs to npm and the entry belongs to a file that belongs to pi. Answering yes to one is not
answering yes to the other.

## Run modes

```bash
bora coding [--force]
bora studio [--force]
bora vstudio [--force]
```

All three follow the same flow: configuration → hardware → RAM gate → content → model → plan →
engine → port → process → health check → foreground.

| Mode | UI | Vision | Sampling `(temp, top_p, top_k)` |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `coding` | no | no | `(0.6, 0.95, 20)` |
| `studio` | yes | no | `(0.7, 0.8, 20)` |
| `vstudio` | yes | yes | `(0.7, 0.8, 20)` |

`--force` skips only the 28 GiB total and 22 GiB available thresholds of the default model. It does
not skip configuration, platform, multi-GPU, engine, model, checksum, port, or health checks.

Once READY, the CLI shows:

- backend and mode;
- the local record, or the non-optimized baseline;
- the API at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`;
- for `studio`/`vstudio`, the UI, and which interface it is;
- the log path, and the interface log when the harness is running.

The contract also exposes `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `/metrics`. The
service listens on `127.0.0.1` only. `/v1/models` reports the model as `Qwen 3.6`, which is the
alias the engine is launched with; that name is what a client sends back in a request, and it is
also what the harness model picker shows.

### Which interface `studio` and `vstudio` open

`bora ui install` decides it, and nothing else does:

| DeepSeek Harness | UI URL | What opens |
|---|---|---|
| installed | `http://127.0.0.1:<ui_port>` | DeepSeek Harness, started as a second managed service |
| not installed | `http://127.0.0.1:<llama_port>/` | the integrated llama.cpp interface |

The browser opens only when `open_browser=true`, and only once **both** services have answered their
own readiness check: the engine its locked health endpoint, the harness its page route. A tab is never
opened onto a page that cannot yet answer.

If the harness is installed but fails to start, the engine keeps serving, the reason and its log are
printed, and the integrated interface opens instead. A UI mode never exits because the interface
failed.

`coding` starts no interface at all and opens no browser.

With `coding` running, a minimal request from another POSIX terminal is:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write a Python sum function."}],"max_tokens":128,"stream":false}'
```

Replace `8080` if `llama_port` differs. Any client compatible with the local OpenAI chat completions
endpoint works; the current managed server requires no key.

The command stays attached to the process. `Ctrl-C` terminates the server, removes the state, and
returns 130. A natural non-zero exit returns 1 and points to the log. When the harness is running it
is taken down first on every exit path, so a live page never keeps talking to a server that is
already terminating.

## `ui install`

```bash
bora ui install [--force]
```

Installs the pinned `@deepseek-ai/dsh` release into a managed npm prefix under the data root.
**`bora engine install` already does this**, so this command is for adding the interface later, or
for repairing it with `--force`. npm's own progress is shown as it resolves and downloads.

It needs **Node.js 22.19 or newer** on `PATH`, which is checked by name before anything is
downloaded, and on Linux a C/C++ toolchain: one dependency ships no prebuilt binary there and is
compiled during the install. Install scripts are deliberately not skipped — the harness mounts that
native dependency as a boot-time plugin, so a tree installed without them does not start at all.

It is never a step of `bora studio`: by the time you launch a mode, the interface is either there or
it is not, and a launch does not stop to download gigabytes.

The version is recorded only after the installation produced the harness entry module, so an
interrupted install reports as absent and the next run rebuilds it rather than trusting a partial
tree. Running it again when the pinned version is already present does nothing; `--force` reinstalls
anyway. It refuses while any managed service is running, because a live interface holds that tree
open.

DeepSeek Harness is an upstream program. bora starts it, configures it through its process
environment and one launch overlay bora owns and rewrites in its own managed root, and never modifies
it, writes into its storage, or calls its API. Its licence ships in
`resources/notices/deepseek-harness-LICENSE`.

## `ui status`

```bash
bora ui status
```

Reports whether the pinned version is installed, where its installation and its home live, and which
port it would listen on.

## `ui remove`

```bash
bora ui remove
```

Removes the managed interface and asks **two separate questions**, because they delete different
kinds of thing:

1. **the installation** — the megabytes bora fetched. Answering yes frees them and prints how much;
   `bora ui install` puts it back;
2. **the harness home** — your sessions, workspaces and settings. This is content you made, it is
   not backed up anywhere, and removing it cannot be undone.

Both default to no. Declining the second leaves your sessions where they were, so a later install
finds them again. Removal refuses while any managed service is running, and never follows a symlink out of
the managed root.

`bora uninstall` deletes both without asking separately, because it deletes the whole data root; its
preview says so.

## `status`

```bash
bora status
```

Shows the service, PID, mode, backend, port, and log. It first verifies each entry through
`pid + create_time`; dead entries, reused PIDs, and PIDs this account can no longer open are
removed with a warning. Malformed JSON state is quarantined as `services.corrupt-<timestamp>.json`.
No services at all is a success with exit code 0.

It also inspects the trial roots of a calibration run that never finished, so a server left behind
by an interrupted `calibrate` is visible here instead of only in the task manager.

## `stop`

```bash
bora stop
```

Stops only processes whose identity matches the state. It waits up to 10 seconds after `terminate`,
then uses `kill` and waits up to 5 seconds. It is idempotent: no services returns 0. Do not delete
`services.json` by hand while the process is alive.

Like `status`, it covers the trial roots of an unfinished calibration, so it is the command that
ends a server an interrupted run left holding VRAM. Running it while a calibration is in progress
therefore stops that calibration's current trial.

## `calibrate`

```bash
bora calibrate --mode <coding|studio|vstudio|all> [--preference <envelope>]
```

The command shows a preflight and asks for confirmation before starting any process. It measures
one `fast`, `balanced`, or `max-context` cell per selected mode, writes that cell into one candidate
record per completed mode, and activates it atomically unless told otherwise.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--mode <id\|all>` | the packaged mode to measure, or every mode (required) |
| `--preference fast\|balanced\|max-context` | optimization rule measured for the cell, default `balanced` |
| `--no-activate` | keeps the new records as candidates, leaving the active ones untouched |
| `--activate` | promotes candidates measured earlier, without new trials |
| `--target-ctx N` | collapses the context ladder onto a single approved step |

```bash
bora calibrate --mode all
bora calibrate --mode coding --preference fast
bora calibrate --mode all --preference max-context --no-activate
bora calibrate --mode all --activate
bora calibrate --mode coding --target-ctx 98304
```

Allowed targets: `131072`, `98304`, `65536`, `49152`, `32768` — the same steps the automatic ladder
descends. The approved scale also names `16384` and `8192`, but the pinned quick-bench long request
does not fit in them, so asking for one is refused before any process starts.
`--activate` cannot be combined with `--target-ctx`, and `--activate` and
`--no-activate` are mutually exclusive. `--activate` cannot relabel a candidate with
`--preference`; each conflict is an input error reported before any process starts.

`--mode all` applies the same preference to all three modes. Run individual mode commands when,
for example, `coding` should retain `fast`, `studio` `balanced`, and `vstudio` `max-context`.

`max-context` is the cheapest preference to measure: the ladder descends, so the first context that
yields a sample already wins and the remaining steps are skipped. `fast` and `balanced` compare
latency across contexts and walk the whole ladder.

All five options are ordinary Typer options and appear in generated `calibrate --help`, so shell
completion and the TUI composer consume the same public surface. Repeating a singleton option uses
Click's standard last-occurrence behavior; the preflight always prints the selected value before the
confirmation.

Trial reserves, written into every record: 0.5 GiB VRAM, 2.0 GiB RAM, 0.125 GiB release tolerance.

On an interactive terminal the run shows a live bar with the phase, the trial, the elapsed time, and
an estimate learned from the current phase; redirected output stays line-oriented, one line per
completed trial. Every phase total is a cap (`<=N`), not a schedule or a promise. The final summary
prints the one measured cell per completed mode and reports its observed RAM and VRAM minima.

When a run activates a `coding` record it also names the context window that record now carries and
the command that hands it to the pi agent — `bora pi`, or `bora pi --install` when pi is not
installed. Nothing else has to be done: the launcher already reads the new record itself. With
`--no-activate` there is no such line, because a candidate steers no launch.

Calibration uploads nothing, does not modify `config.toml`, and installs neither the model nor the
engine. Trials use the configured port when it is free and fall back to a system-assigned loopback
port when it is busy; that fallback does not apply to the three normal launches.

Algorithm and record details: [Calibration](calibration.md).

## `update`

```bash
bora update --check
bora update
```

Compares the installed version with the newest GitHub Release and, unless `--check` was given,
installs it. Both forms print the installed and the published version first; when nothing newer is
published, both exit with 0 and change nothing. An update never downgrades: only a strictly newer
`major.minor.patch` is installed.

The installation repeats the trust chain of the documented manual install. The command downloads
the release `SHA256SUMS` and the release wheel over HTTPS, refuses any hop that leaves HTTPS,
compares the wheel's SHA-256 with the manifest, and only then hands the verified file to
`uv tool install --force --python 3.12.13`. The wheel is kept under the managed cache root.

**The managed engine is not reinstalled.** It lives under the data root and survives the tool
replacement untouched. Before scheduling the installation, `update` reads `engine.lock` out of the
downloaded wheel and reports one of three things: that the new version keeps the active engine
release, that it pins a different one and `bora engine install` is required afterwards, or that the
lock could not be read and `bora engine status` should be checked. Calibration records, the
configuration, and the model are equally untouched.

Two situations are refused with exit code 1: a live managed service, because the running launcher
still holds the environment uv has to replace, and an installation `uv tool` does not own — a
development checkout for example — which must use the documented installer instead.

Because Windows cannot replace the environment of the process that is still running, `uv` is invoked
by a helper that waits for this command to exit, exactly as `uninstall` does. Exit code 0 therefore
reports that the installation was *scheduled*, not that uv succeeded: uv writes its own output to
the same terminal a moment later, and `bora --version` is the confirmation.

## `uninstall`

```bash
bora uninstall
```

Refuses to proceed while a live managed service exists. It shows the configuration, data, cache,
state, and the current Python installation, then asks for a single confirmation. If the command
comes from the supported `uv tool` installation, it also removes the Python tool through uv as soon
as the process exits; uv itself stays unchanged. A Python installation not managed by uv is reported
explicitly and is not removed on a guess. A normal cancellation deletes nothing and exits with 0;
`Ctrl-C` exits with 130.

The model store is inside the data root, so its weights go with it. Weights that also exist in the
Hugging Face cache are offered afterwards as a **separate question**, defaulting to no and using
the same confinement rules as `rm`. It is asked only once the managed roots are actually gone, and
a failure or refusal there leaves the completed uninstall successful.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | success, empty state, or warnings only |
| `1` | expected operational error or failed validation |
| `2` | invalid CLI input or configuration |
| `130` | keyboard interrupt |

Expected operational errors are written to stderr without a traceback. A traceback instead indicates
an unexpected bug and should be reported with the command that was run, the output, and a log
reviewed for private data.

# Configuration and local data

## File and precedence

The configuration lives in `config_dir()/config.toml`. The keys sit at the root of the document:

```toml
model = "unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M"
llama_port = 8080
ui_port = 3080
open_browser = true
# model_path = "~/models/custom.gguf"
# engine_path = "~/bin/llama-server"
```

Precedence is:

1. environment variable;
2. `config.toml`;
3. code defaults.

The TOML file is validated **in full before** the environment overrides are applied. An unknown key
or a malformed value therefore stays an error even when a variable would replace it. The launcher
never creates or rewrites `config.toml` automatically.

The read-only TUI retains the winning source beside each resolved value: `environment`,
`config.toml`, or `default`. This is provenance for presentation, not another configuration layer;
all existing commands consume the same resolved `Config`, and collecting provenance writes nothing.
An empty optional path variable is still reported as `environment`, because that explicit override
is what cleared the file value.

## Public keys

| Key | Environment variable | Default | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `BORA_MODEL` | the pinned model | non-empty string |
| `model_path` | `BORA_MODEL_PATH` | absent | path string |
| `llama_port` | `BORA_LLAMA_PORT` | `8080` | integer 1–65535 |
| `ui_port` | `BORA_UI_PORT` | `3080` | integer 1–65535, and never equal to `llama_port` |
| `engine_path` | `BORA_ENGINE_PATH` | absent | path string |
| `open_browser` | `BORA_OPEN_BROWSER` | `true` | boolean |

In TOML, booleans must be `true` or `false`. In the environment the following are accepted,
case-insensitively:

```text
true/false  1/0  yes/no  on/off
```

A `BORA_MODEL_PATH` or `BORA_ENGINE_PATH` variable that is present but empty
clears the path. Other empty variables are errors. Paths expand `~`, but they are not checked
against the filesystem while the configuration alone is being loaded.

The two ports must differ, and that is checked while the configuration is resolved, before either
process starts. The default is `3080`, which is the harness's own default and does not collide
with `llama_port`, so unlike the interface it replaces nothing had to be moved out of the way.

No keys other than these six are accepted; endpoints, bind addresses, mmproj, arbitrary `llama.cpp`
flags, and every harness setting are not configurable here. bora sets the interface's process
environment and its launch overlay itself, and grows no key that means "a harness setting";
everything the interface lets you change belongs to the interface and is yours.

## Terminal UI motion

`BORA_TUI_MOTION` is a presentation-only environment control, not a `config.toml` key. It accepts
exactly `auto` (the default) or `off`; an empty, differently cased, or unknown value exits with
invalid-input status 2. `off` removes every animation timer while leaving the complete static TUI
and all commands available.

Automatic motion is decorative and carries no unique information. Three blue-to-white Unicode wind
rows and a layered blue sea update at 6 frames per second on whichever focused page is visible at
80x24 or larger, below the 12 fps ceiling. Home and an open section share that one timer, so moving
between them neither restarts nor duplicates it. `BORA_TUI_MOTION=off` removes the timer but retains
a static frame around the shared `Bora Workbench` title. Losing detectable focus, shrinking the
terminal, selecting root `--plain`, setting `NO_COLOR`, using `TERM=dumb` or limited encoding, or
unmounting removes the timer immediately; capability switches also hide the bands.

The existing observation in
[`evidence/tui/ubuntu-motion.json`](../evidence/tui/ubuntu-motion.json) measured the superseded
finite 8 fps implementation. Its 2.666 percentage-point active-window result and static settled
window are retained as history, not claimed for the current continuous effect, which now also runs
while a section is read. A new Ubuntu observation and the Windows visual/CPU checks have not been
performed.

## Model identity and path

`model` is a declarative identity used by locks, records, and state. `model_path` is the physical
file passed to the engine. The valid combinations are:

- default model + no `model_path`: resolution from the managed store, then the pinned Hugging Face
  snapshot;
- different model + explicit `model_path`: a local GGUF, with no inherited calibration or
  guarantees.

The default model with an explicit `model_path` is rejected, so the bytes cannot be silently
replaced while the verified identity is kept. A different model without a path is rejected.

For the default model the managed store at `<data root>/models` is searched first. It is the only
location `pull` writes and `rm` deletes. When it holds no file with the locked name, the pinned
Hugging Face snapshot is used instead, read-only, and its cache lookup follows the order observed in
the engine release:

1. `LLAMA_CACHE`;
2. `HF_HUB_CACHE`;
3. `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`;
4. `HF_HOME/hub`;
5. `XDG_CACHE_HOME/huggingface/hub`;
6. `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`.

The launcher reads only
`models--<repository>/snapshots/<pinned-revision>/<filename>` and verifies the size and SHA-256. It
does not follow moving branches and never writes into that cache. `rm` and `uninstall` can delete
those exact artifacts from it, each behind its own confirmation.

## Engine resolution

The executable is looked up in this order:

1. an explicit `engine_path`;
2. `llama-server` / `llama-server.exe` on the `PATH`;
3. the managed installation pointed at by `data_dir()/engine/current.json`.

Every candidate must pass the version and help probes from `engine.lock`. An executable that is
found but incompatible produces an error: it is not skipped in favor of the next candidate.

## Public directories

The helpers compute the paths without creating any directory.

| Root | Ubuntu/Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| configuration | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/bora-workbench` | `%APPDATA%\bora-workbench` |
| data | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/bora-workbench` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bora-workbench\data` |
| cache | `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/bora-workbench` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bora-workbench\cache` |
| state | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/bora-workbench` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bora-workbench\state` |

An XDG, `APPDATA`, or `LOCALAPPDATA` variable that is missing, empty, or relative uses the fallback;
an absolute value is honored. On Windows the fallbacks are `~/AppData/Roaming` and
`~/AppData/Local`. `bora doctor` prints the four paths resolved for the current machine.

## Data layout

Operations create only what they own:

```text
config_dir()/
└── config.toml                         # written by the user only

data_dir()/
├── engine/
│   ├── current.json                    # atomic pointer to the active engine
│   └── installations/<id>/             # immutable installations
├── calibration/
│   ├── records/
│   │   ├── <mode>.json                 # active record
│   │   ├── <mode>.candidate.json       # inactive candidate
│   │   └── <mode>.previous.json        # single previous slot
│   └── evidence/<run-id>/              # private logs of the last calibration run

cache_dir()/
└── llama.cpp/                           # managed engine downloads and staging

state_dir()/
├── services.json                        # process state, version 1
├── start.lock                           # startup serialization
└── logs/llama-server-<timestamp>.log
```

The `calibration/evidence` directory keeps a single run UUID: once the new run is promoted, the
previous managed ones are removed. Records are private and are not wheel content.

## What `uninstall` deletes

After confirmation, exactly the four roots above are deleted, including the model store inside the
data root. Excluded are:

- the Hugging Face cache, whose pinned artifacts are offered afterwards as a separate question;
- external GGUF and mmproj files;
- executables pointed at by `engine_path` or found on the `PATH`;
- uv, its caches, and other tools;
- any path outside the managed roots.

If the current command belongs to exactly the `bora-workbench` environment configured by uv, the same
confirmation also schedules the removal of that environment and of the command. Python installations
outside `uv tool` stay unchanged and are reported in the summary.

"""Run the managed llama-server lifecycle: preflight, spawn, readiness, status, and stop.

This is one of the four modules allowed to branch on the operating system (specification section
4.1) and the branch is confined to `_creation_flags`, which needs a new Windows process group so a
console signal cannot reach the child. Every decision about a live process uses the mandatory
pid/create_time identity of specification section 5.9, read through `_process_state`, so a signal is
never sent to a stranger that merely reuses a recorded PID.
